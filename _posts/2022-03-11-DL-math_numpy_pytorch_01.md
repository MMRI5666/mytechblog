<b>Scalar</b>: In vector space, a <em>scalar</em> is used to define elements of a field. In linear algebra, real numbers or generally, elements of a field are called scalars and relate to vectors in an associated vector space.<br>
<b>Vector</b>:  A quantity described by multiple scalars, such as having both direction and magnitude, is called a <em>vector</em>.<br>
<b>Matrix</b>: In mathematics, a <em>matrix</em> (plural matrices) is a rectangular array or table of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns, which is used to represent a mathematical object or a property of such an object.<br>
<b>tensor</b>: In mathematics, a <em>tensor</em> is an algebraic object that describes a multilinear relationship between sets of algebraic objects related to a vector space.
