<b>Scalar</b>: In vector space, a <em>scalar</em> is used to define elements of a field. In linear algebra, real numbers or generally, elements of a field are called scalars and relate to vectors in an associated vector space.<br>
<b>Vector</b>:  A quantity described by multiple scalars, such as having both direction and magnitude, is called a <em>vector</em>.
