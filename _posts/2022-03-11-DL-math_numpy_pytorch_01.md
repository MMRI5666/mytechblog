## Linear Algebra Terminology
Figure-1 shows some linear algebra terminilogies that are very commonly used in deep learning.

<b>Scalar</b>: In vector space, a <em>scalar</em> is used to define elements of a field. In linear algebra, real numbers or generally, elements of a field are called scalars and relate to vectors in an associated vector space.<br>
<b>Vector</b>:  A quantity described by multiple scalars, such as having both direction and magnitude, is called a <em>vector</em>.<br>
<b>Matrix</b>: In mathematics, a <em>matrix</em> (plural matrices) is a rectangular array or table of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns, which is used to represent a mathematical object or a property of such an object.<br>
<b>tensor</b>: In mathematics, a <em>tensor</em> is an algebraic object that describes a multilinear relationship between sets of algebraic objects related to a vector space.<br>

Figure-2 shows a Euclidean vector, which its coordinates x and y are scalars, but v is a vector that defined by scalars x and y.<br>
