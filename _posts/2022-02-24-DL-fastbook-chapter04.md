## Computer vision begins with `Pixels`
The first step in understanding what is going on inside a computer vision model is to comprehend how computer interact with images. This chapter tries to explain the foundation of computer vision conducting some experimentations on the very popular data set MNIST, which contains images of handwritten digits collected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology by Yann Lecun and his Colleagues.

In a computer, everything is represented as a number, therefor, to view the numbers that make up this image, we have to convert it to NumPy or PyTorch tensor.
