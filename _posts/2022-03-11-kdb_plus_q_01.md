# kdb+ and q: A Language for Vector Prgramming
## Types in q:
  1.  int: q has different types of integer types including: 16 byte, 32 byte, and 64 byte. In the lates version of q, i.e., q 3+, the integers are 64 byte and is called <em>long</em>. A shorter type of integer exists in q that is called <em>int</em> and should be followed by an <em>i</em>.
  2.  <em>boolean</em: the boolean type in q are defined with 0 and 1 following by a small b, i.e., 1b for True and 0b for False. q stores each boolean value in a byte.
  A <em><b>list of boolean values</em></b> is defined as a sequence of 0 and 1 following by a small be at the end, for example 0110111b is a list containing 7 boolean values.
  Comparing two values in any types results in a boolean value, e.g., 42=6\*7 results in 1b.
  Applying 


## Arithmatic Operators:
  * Like all other prgoramming languages, q prvides all 4 main arithmatic operators, but with one difference that the division operator is represented by percentage symbol (%).


## q special operators:
  1.  <b>count</b>: counts number of elements exist in a list.
  2.  <b>till</b>: <em>till a</em> generates a list of numbers from 0 to a<em>a</em>, but 3 is not included.
  3.  

{% include note.html text="<b>Unlike all other programming languages, q applies the arithmetic operators differently when evaluating expressions. The arithmetic operators are evaluated in order from left to right without discrimination.
