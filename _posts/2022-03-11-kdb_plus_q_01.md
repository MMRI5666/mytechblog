# kdb+ and q: A Language for Vector Prgramming
## Types in q:
  1.  <em><b>int</b></em>: q has different types of integer types including: 16 byte, 32 byte, and 64 byte. In the lates version of q, i.e., q 3+, the integers are 64 byte and is called <em>long</em>. A shorter type of integer exists in q that is called <em>int</em> and should be followed by an <em>i</em>.
  2.  <em><b>boolean</b></em>: the boolean type in q are defined with 0 and 1 following by a small b, i.e., 1b for True and 0b for False. q stores each boolean value in a byte.
  A <em><b>list of boolean values</b></em> is defined as a sequence of 0 and 1 following by a small be at the end, for example 0110111b is a list containing 7 boolean values.
  Comparing two values in any types results in a boolean value, e.g., 42=6\*7 results in 1b.
  3. <em><b>Date and Time</b></em>: q counts dates from the millinium, and counts Time from mid-night. Therefore, we can have the following expressions:
*   2000.01.01=0 results 1b
*   1999.12.31=-1 results 1b
*   2000.01.02+1 results 2000.01.02


## Arithmatic Operators:
  * Like all other prgoramming languages, q prvides all 4 main arithmatic operators, but with one difference that the division operator is represented by percentage symbol (%).
  * In q, arithmatic operators are vectorized operators. It means the unlinke other programming languages, the arithmatic operators are applied to two vectors, or two lists, element-wise (each element from the first vector and its corresponding element from second vector).


  {% include note.html text="Comparing two unequal-sized vectors or evaluating them against any arithmetic operators raise an error.
  </p>
" %}



## q special operators:
  1.  <b>count</b>: counts number of elements exist in a list.
  2.  <b>till</b>: <em>till a</em> generates a list of numbers from 0 to a<em>a</em>, but 3 is not included.
  3.  

{% include info.html text="Unlike all other programming languages, q applies the arithmetic operators differently when evaluating expressions. The arithmetic operators are evaluated in order from left to right without discrimination.
" %}


## Tables
Since vectors are the data structure that q is based upon, and vectorize operators are the cornerstones of the q language, we may assume that designing a table based on vectors would be considerably easier in q. If the columns in a table are only some lists, or equivalently, some vectors, the table will be a collection of columns rather than rows, as opposed to what we see in other database and programming concepts. Thus, applying the q's vectorized operators to a table defined with this approach will amazingly efficient.
Example: let's define a oversimplified trade table containing some columns including: dates, times, quantities, symbol (ticker symbol), and prices.

{% include important.html text="Unlike other database and programming languages, q's tables are collection of columns rather than collection of rows
" %}

```python
# defining a series (vector) of 10000000 random dates
codes:
dates: 2018.01.01+10000000?31
count dates
```
    10000000

```python
# defining a series (vector) of 10000000 random times
times: 10000000?24:00:00.0000

# defining a series (vector) of 10000000 random number 
# that represents the quantities
qtys: 1+10000000?100

# defining a series (vector) of 10000000 random number within 0-2
ixs: 10000000?3

# defining a series (vector) of 10000000 random lables 'aapl', 'amzn', 
# and 'googl'each of which associates with one element of ixs
syms: `aapl`amzn`googl ixs
syms
```
    `amzn`amzn`amzn`googl`amzn`amzn`aapl`googl`amzn`amzn`aapl`googl`amzn`aapl`aap..

q considers a list to be a function that maps the index to the items at that index. In other words, a function that retrieve the item at that position.

```python
# defining 10000000 random prices and associate them 
# with index 0, 1, and 2
pxs:(1+10000000?.03)*172 1189.0 1073.0 ixs


# define table
t: ([] date:dates;time:times;sym:syms;qty:qtys;px:pxs)

# show first 10 observations of each columns (first 10 rows)
10#t
```
    date       time         sym   qty px

## qSQL
The q programing language offers SQL-like commands for manipulating data, which are called <em><b>qSQL commands</b></em>. Let's try some examples with qSQL.

```python
# retrieve 5 observations of each columns date, time, qty, and px
5# select date, time, qty, px from t
```
    5# select date, time, qty, px from t
    date       time         qty px
    ------------------------------------
    2018.01.01 00:00:01.129 88  222.3173
    2018.01.01 00:00:02.099 80  1310.515
    2018.01.01 00:00:02.670 14  175.4603
    2018.01.01 00:00:02.885 93  1446.401
    2018.01.01 00:00:03.396 76  201.7421

```python
# retrieve a list of first 5 items for Apple
5# select date, time, qty, px from t where sym=`aapl
```
    date       time         qty px       sym
    -----------------------------------------
    2018.01.01 00:00:01.129 88  222.3173 aapl
    2018.01.01 00:00:02.670 14  175.4603 aapl
    2018.01.01 00:00:03.396 76  201.7421 aapl
    2018.01.01 00:00:04.772 23  219.4052 aapl
    2018.01.01 00:00:05.190 54  207.8848 aapl


{% include info.html text="When you want to evaluate your codes time execution, you need prefix your code with \t.
" %}

```python
\t select date, time, qty, px from t where sym=`aapl
```
    94

It means that extracting the whole list of Apple items from the 10000000 observations took just 94ms!

<u>Example 2</u>:
Imagine we want to have a list trades grouped by date and time and calculate the open and close price for each day.
```python
10# select open:first px, close:last px by data, time from t where sym=`aapl
```
    date       time        | open     close
    -----------------------| -----------------
    2018.01.01 00:00:01.129| 222.3173 222.3173
    2018.01.01 00:00:02.670| 175.4603 175.4603
    2018.01.01 00:00:03.396| 201.7421 201.7421
    2018.01.01 00:00:04.772| 219.4052 219.4052
    2018.01.01 00:00:05.190| 207.8848 207.8848
    2018.01.01 00:00:05.254| 179.5007 179.5007
    2018.01.01 00:00:05.263| 192.339  192.339
    2018.01.01 00:00:08.121| 208.1961 208.1961
    2018.01.01 00:00:10.048| 205.9481 205.9481
    2018.01.01 00:00:10.226| 198.7254 198.7254

It took 1.651 sec to calculate the list above (CPU: Intel Core i5)!

<u>Example 3</u>:
If in previous example, we would like to add the lower and higher parice for each day to the list, the code will be like below:
```python
10# select open:first px, close:last px, low:min px, high:max px by data, time from t where sym=`aapl
```
    date       time        | open     close    low      high

    2018.01.01 00:00:01.129| 222.3173 222.3173 222.3173 222.3173
    2018.01.01 00:00:02.670| 175.4603 175.4603 175.4603 175.4603

<u>Example 4</u>:
<p>This example addresses a more complicated query, which can answer one of the most common problem in equity trading world.</p>
<p>Grouping data by intervals, especially time intervals, is very important in the equity trading world when people might want to know when to buy and sell by time intervals. To make this problem clear, let's imagine we have a trade table that is based on milliseconds and I want to know the bucketed volume-weighted average price, which is bucketed by hundred-millisecond intervals.
The crucial question here is what is the volume-weighted average price in each interval because this can be considered as a stand-in for the price in its pertinent interval. This can be calculated interval by interval to have a closer to the real running estimation rather than tick by tick data.
</p>
<pCalculating maximum idealized profit or conversely, calculating maximum drawdown is very strategic in equity trading. This, in layman's terms, means how much I could have made if I knew the future and I knew what trade was going to be. In other words,  if I bought at the lowest price and sold at the highest price after, or conversely if I had bought at the absolute highest price and sold it at the worst time after.
</p>
To solve this problem more intuitively, we will try to reach the one-line code solution through three steps as follows:
  1. For each interval, calculate the running minimum as follows:
```python
# calculate running minimum for each interval
5# select mins px from t where sym=`aapl
px
```
    px
    --------
    172.5521
    172.5521
    172.0294
    172.0294
    172.0294

  2. Calculate the profit in each interval if the purchase had already been made at the lowest price.
```python
5# select px - mins px from t where sym=`aapl
```
    px
    --------
    0
    3.361679
    0
    3.380834
    2.033886

  3. Calculate the maximum profit if the purchase was made at the lowest price of all time intervals and then sold at a higher price afterward.
```python
select max px - mins px from t where sym=`aapl
```
    px
    --------
    5.159992
