# kdb+ and q: A Language for Vector Prgramming
## Types in q:
  1.  <em><b>int</em></b>: q has different types of integer types including: 16 byte, 32 byte, and 64 byte. In the lates version of q, i.e., q 3+, the integers are 64 byte and is called <em>long</em>. A shorter type of integer exists in q that is called <em>int</em> and should be followed by an <em>i</em>.
  2.  <em><b>boolean</b></em>: the boolean type in q are defined with 0 and 1 following by a small b, i.e., 1b for True and 0b for False. q stores each boolean value in a byte.
  A <em><b>list of boolean values</b></em> is defined as a sequence of 0 and 1 following by a small be at the end, for example 0110111b is a list containing 7 boolean values.
  Comparing two values in any types results in a boolean value, e.g., 42=6\*7 results in 1b.
  3. <em><b>Date and Time</b></em>: q counts dates from the millinium, and counts Time from mid-night. Therefore, we can have the following expressions:
*   2000.01.01=0 results 1b
*   1999.12.31=-1 results 1b
*   2000.01.02+1 results 2000.01.02
