# kdb+ and q: A Language for Vector Prgramming
## Types in q:
  1.  int: q has different types of integer types including: 16 byte, 32 byte, and 64 byte. In the lates version of q, i.e., q 3+, the integers are 64 byte and is called <em>long</em>. A shorter type of integer exists in q that is called <em>int</em> and should be followed by an <em>i</em>.


## Arithmatic Operators:
Like all other prgoramming languages, q prvides all 4 main arithmatic operators, but with one difference that the division operator is represented by percentage symbol (%).

## q special operators:
  1.  <b>count</b>: counts number of elements exist in a list.


{% include note.html text="<b>Unlike all other programming language, q has its special rule in applying the arithmatic operators when evaluating the expressions. All arithmatic operators are evaluated in order from left to right without any discrimination.
